                    This is the homepage of Kazuhiko Itaya Laboratory, Graduate School of Regional Management, Kagawa University. At Itaya Lab, we are advancing education and research, focusing on fields such as technology management and innovation, covering a wide range of processes from creation of epoch-making ideas to the changes in the society.  We instruct many students through ordinary classes, seminars and exchanges after graduation. In addition, we are interacting with people from the local companies and overseas researchers in various ways.

                    Kazuhiko Itaya, Currently, Professor, Graduate School of Regional Management, Kagawa University (MBA) in Japan
Dr. Itaya received his MS in coordinated sciences from the University of Tokyo, and also received his Ph.D. in engineering from the University of Tokyo.  He joined Toshiba Corporation in 1986, engaged in research and development of visible light from lasers and LEDs.  After being a visiting researcher at UCSB (1993-1995), he returned to Toshiba and became a research group leader and a senior manager in the field of MEMS and heterogeneous device integration technology.  Furthermore, he also received his Ph.D. in arts and sciences (2010), finishing the Ph. D. program of technology management at the University of Tokyo.  In 2013, he assumed a position as a professor of Tokyo University of Agriculture and has been in office of current position since 2017.  He mainly engaged in research on promoting creativity and serendipity.  He received an award of PICMET '17 Conference Brad W. Hosler Outstanding Student Paper Award Nominating Professor in 2017.

                    The approach to innovation is complex and long-lasting, but unexpected things which is "accidental" and or "emergent" could be the keys, and "mavericks" who are cut-out but incompatible with team members could propose unprecedented ideas.  For another example, the executives of an organization who should be called "connoisseurs" sometimes allow the activities of heretics by overcoming the opposition of the surroundings, resulting in a breakthrough business.
At Itaya Lab, we are exploring the processes of innovation involving chances and key persons.  Since many of these are rare events, it is difficult to perform conventional quantitative analysis, and it is necessary to devise research and analysis. We mainly conduct research and analysis by qualitative methods that increase the degree of abstraction from narrative.
For example, in science and technology, invention and discovery are central to creative activities.  Invention is centered by activities of creation, and in terms of creation, it is becoming clear that the keys are: stimulating intrinsic motivation of individuals, activating activities as a team or an organization and flexible engagement of the executives sharing the presence of the site.  On the other hand, there are many mysterious aspects in the process of discovery. Some, for example, is discovered by chance called serendipity.  Little has been known about how it is generated in the organization and how we can promote it.  So far, the importance of "unobtrusiveness", that is, leaving it to the autonomy of the researchers who aspire to discover, immersing themselves in unprecedented trial and error, is becoming apparent by degrees.
